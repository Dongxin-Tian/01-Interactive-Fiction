# 01-Interactive-Fiction
A zombie survival interactive fiction game made with python and twine.
This game is purely random, so every play through would be different. The player has to choose wisely in order to successfully escape. There are many paths for players to choose, each of which will lead the player to a different area and a different situation. All weapons and health need to be used rationally. The goal of the game is to reach the school's evacuation point without dying.

## Implementation
Built using Visual Studio Code and Python 3.8.5. game.json was created in Twine 2 and exported with Twison 0.0.1 (https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison)
